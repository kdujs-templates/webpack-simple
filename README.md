# webpack-simple

> A simple Kdu 2.0 Webpack & `kdu-loader` setup for quick prototyping. Note this template is not suitable for production - for that you may want to use the [full webpack template](https://github.com/kdujs-templates/webpack).

### Usage

This is a project template for [kdu-cli](https://github.com/kdujs/kdu-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g kdu-cli
$ kdu init webpack-simple my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### What's Included

- `npm run dev`: Webpack + `kdu-loader` with proper config for source maps & hot-reload.

- `npm run build`: build with HTML/CSS/JS minification.

### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can fork this repo to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `kdu-cli`:

``` bash
kdu init username/repo my-project
```
